# TSP solver using adaptive EDA
Python code generated by ChatGPT to solve an instance of the TSP by using a EDA.
I asked ChatGPT to answer the question below:

"I want to solve the travelling salesman problem by using the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm. I want in the EDA, that you first explore more the solution space and only later in the iterations switch focus from exploration to exploitation. This balance between exploration and exploitation should be dependent on the solutions found so far. That is, when for a certain exploration-exploitation balance the set of individuals doesnâ€™t improve that much anymore, then focus more on further exploitation. Can you provide me the python code for this and also provide me a simple instance of a TSP?"

ChatGPT and I needed 11 iterations before we had Python code that could run and find a solution. After each iteration I provided ChatGPT with the error message generated by Python and got newly generated code back.
